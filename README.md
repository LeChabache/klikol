# Klikol

Klikol is a modular, feature-rich Flutter application built using the MVVM architecture. It serves as a scalable foundation for building real-world services such as marketplaces, ride-sharing, service hiring, product listings, and more â€” all in one app.

This project is open-source and designed to be practical, production-ready, and extensible. Firebase is used for authentication, real-time updates, cloud storage, and push notifications.
